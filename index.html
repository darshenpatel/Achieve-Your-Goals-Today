      <p>WHY do you get up in the morning? WHY does your organization exist? Your WHY is the purpose, cause or belief that inspires you to do what you do. When you think, act and communicate starting with WHY, you can inspire others.</p>

  <section id="section-b">
      <p>If you don't know WHY the goals are important to you, then it's just random. Understanding the WHY will give you a stronger sense of purpose, and this sense of purpose will keep you motivated during the difficult times. When you lack a sense of purpose if things do start to go awry, there is nothing stopping you from downgrading your goals and lowering the bar. To achieve big bold goals, you need to be firm on them, but flexible on the approach, and having a strong WHY will help you keep your eyes on the prize and keep going in the tough times.</p>

      If you want to set yourself big bold goals, then to increase your chance of success, be clear about what success looks like, and understand WHY it's important to you, break it down to even smaller goals, track your performance and celebrate each small success.

      Whether youâ€™re an entrepreneur, an employee, a leader of a team or division or you want to tackle the WHY of your entire organization, discovering the WHY injects passion into your work. And it's those who start with WHY that have the ability to inspire those around them.
